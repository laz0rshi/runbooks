# Pandoc document template

## Description

This repository contains a simple template for building
[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) documents; Pandoc is a suite of tools to compile
markdown files into readable files (PDF, EPUB, HTML...).

## Usage

### Installing

In order to use this makefile you will need to make sure that the following
dependencies are installed on your system:
  - GNU make
  - Pandoc
  - LuaLaTeX
  - DejaVu Sans fonts


You can find the list of all available keys on [this
page](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block).

### Creating chapters

Creating a new chapter is as simple as creating a new markdown file in the
*src/* folder; you'll end up with something like this:

```
src/01-introduction.md
src/02-installation.md
src/03-usage.md
src/04-references.md
```

Pandoc and Make will join them automatically ordered by name; that's why the
numeric prefixes are being used.

All you need to specify for each chapter at least one title:

```md
# Introduction

This is the first paragraph of the introduction chapter.

## First

This is the first subsection.

## Second

This is the second subsection.
```

Each title (*#*) will represent a chapter, while each subtitle (*##*) will
represent a chapter's section. You can use as many levels of sections as
markdown supports.

#### Links between chapters

Anchor links can be used to link chapters within the document:

```md
// src/01-introduction.md
# Introduction

For more information, check the [Usage] chapter.

// src/02-installation.md
# Usage

...
```

If you want to rename the reference, use this syntax:

```md
For more information, check [this](#usage) chapter.
```

Anchor names should be downcased, and spaces, colons, semicolons... should be
replaced with hyphens. Instead of `Chapter title: A new era`, you have:
`#chapter-title-a-new-era`.

#### Links between sections

It's the same as anchor links:

```md
# Introduction

## First

For more information, check the [Second] section.

## Second

...
```

Or, with al alternative name:

```md
For more information, check [this](#second) section.
```

### Inserting objects

Text. That's cool. What about images and tables?

#### Insert an image

Use Markdown syntax to insert an image with a caption:

```md
![A cool seagull.](images/seagull.png)
```

Pandoc will automatically convert the image into a figure (image + caption).

If you want to resize the image, you may use this syntax, available in Pandoc
1.16:

```md
![A cool seagull.](images/seagull.png){ width=50% height=50% }
```

Also, to reference an image, use LaTeX labels:

```md
Please, admire the gloriousnes of Figure \ref{seagull_image}.

![A cool seagull.\label{seagull_image}](images/seagull.png)
```

#### Insert a table

Use markdown table, and use the `Table: <Your table description>` syntax to add
a caption:

```md
| Index | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| 0     | AAA  |
| 1     | BBB  |
| ...   | ...  |

Table: This is an example table.
```

If you want to reference a table, use LaTeX labels:

```md
Please, check Table /ref{example_table}.

| Index | Name |
| ----- | ---- |
| 0     | AAA  |
| 1     | BBB  |
| ...   | ...  |

Table: This is an example table.\label{example_table}
```

### Testing Markdown

I just love **bold text.**\
\This is to escape \
Ialicized text is the *cat's meow* .

## Images

1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.

    ![Tux, the Linux mascot](./images/tux.avi)

3. Close the file.
